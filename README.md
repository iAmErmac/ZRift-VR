## Recommended mods to combine with:

  - Since the included flashlight has been removed, you are required to use this Flashlight mod instead

* [Hyper-V:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/Hyper-V)
  - Enables a lot of VR focused features such as positional melee attacks and item pulling
  
* [DamNums:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - DamNums is a pretty simple concept: shoot monsters and little numbers pop out that tell you how much damage you did
  
* [Top HP Bars:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - Really simple mod to add HP bars on top of enemies and players. Performance version is recommended for VR
  
* [Bolognese Universal Gore:](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/bolognese-gore-mod-v20)
  - A mod-friendly universal gore mod for Doom, Doom 2, Final Doom, Heretic, Hexen, Strife, Hacx, FreeDoom, Chex Quest and anything else you can run on Zandronum/GZDoom
  
* [Nash Gore:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=62641)
  - The father of gore mods. The original brutal modification for (G)ZDoom returns, with a Vengeance

* [The Ultimate Torment and Torture](https://www.realm667.com/index.php/en/projects-mainmenu-50/104-projects/finished/289-the-ultimate-torment-a-torture)
  - This mapset is very recommended to play with ZRift

* [Scythe2](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/scythe2)
